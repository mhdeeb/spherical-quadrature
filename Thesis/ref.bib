abstract = {In the companion paper (Bellet et al., 2021), a spherical harmonic subspace associated to the Cubed Sphere has been introduced. This subspace is further analyzed here. In particular, it permits to define a new Cubed Sphere based quadrature. This quadrature inherits the rotational invariance properties of the spherical harmonic subspace. Contrary to Gaussian quadrature, where the set of nodes and weights is solution of a nonlinear system, only the weights are unknown here. Despite this conceptual simplicity, the new quadrature displays an accuracy comparable to optimal quadratures, such as the Lebedev rules.}

@article{Gauss-Legendre,
  abstract = {{Gauss-Legendre quadrature rules are of considerable theoretical and practical interest because of their role in numerical integration and interpolation. In this paper, a series expansion for the zeros of the Legendre polynomials is constructed. In addition, a series expansion useful for the computation of the Gauss-Legendre weights is derived. Together, these two expansions provide a practical and fast iteration-free method to compute individual Gauss-Legendre node-weight pairs in O(1) complexity and with double precision accuracy. An expansion for the barycentric interpolation weights for the Gauss-Legendre nodes is also derived. A C++ implementation is available online.}},
